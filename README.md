Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of this app were to create a weight tracking software that helped users log daily information. The goals were to successfully create a fully functioning and responsive application on Android Studio that was ultimately error free. I added different elements that my instructor said needed to be included in this design process.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The goals were to successfully create a user login screen, create a database shell and display that database’s information on a user’s screen using a grid, Develop code that prompts users for permission to send SMS messaging notifications and makes the app function based on the individual user's response, and Employ industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance readability of code.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

While coding the app I looeked at the weekly resources my instructor added for us to use and learn from. There were many resources from Android Studio that showed us how to code in certain elements to be seccussful. These articles helped me a lot if I got stuck or had a question. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ran my code every few lines to ensure that my code was fully functioning and error free. Testing the build every few lines helps to make sure little problems can be resoved before they turn major. It revealed that my app was functioning and I overall created a successful weight tracking app. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

One step where I had to innovate and think about the next steps was when I had to create three different screens that all had to function together to make the app run. This got complicated at times due to not one but three screens needing to work together. I think I was very successful in demonstrating my knowlege with adding the login screens, grids, and SMS mobile response screens.
